## 我从未看过荒原 

```
我从未看过荒原-- 
我从未看过海洋-- 
可我知道石楠的容貌 
和狂涛巨浪。 

我从未与上帝交谈 
也不曾拜访过天堂-- 
可我好像已通过检查 
一定会到那个地方 。 

I never saw a Moor-- 
I never saw the Sea-- 
Yet know I how the Heather looks 
And what a Billow be. 

I never spoke with God 
Nor visited in Heaven-- 
Yet certain am I of the spot 
As if the Checks were given--
  ```
