# Lesson One： Pronunciation and Accentuation
## Vowels

**a**,**e**,**i**,**o**,**u**

**á**，**é**，**í**，**ó**，**ú**


Quenya vowels are pure. (don't blur it) In Quenya *all* vowels, in *all* positions, must be clearly and distictly pronounced.

Quenya has *long* and *short* vowels.

**-a** and **-ë** need to be pronounced as a full vowel at the *end* of words

## Dipthongs
**ai**,**au**,**eu**,**iu**,**oi** and **ui**

## Consonants
**C** is always prnounced **K**

In the groups **hw,hy,hl,hr**, the letter **h** is not to be pronounced separately.

At the begining of words(before a vowel), the letter **h** is to pronounced like English h, but in the middle of words, **h** is to be pronounced [x]. (**h** before **t** and the vowels **a,o,u** is pronounced [x] and **h** before the vowels **i** and **e** turns into a sound similar to German ich-Laut)
